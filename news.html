  <h2>Hope in Action</h2>
  <p>
    When God blesses us, we try as much as possible to bless others. 
With grateful hearts, Last Hope Foundation is excited to announce our Christmas Eve Joy Outreach. A special moment dedicated to putting smiles on the faces of children in need around Central Monrovia.
🌐 Location: Central Monrovia
📅 Date: December 24
⏰ Time: 11:00 AM
This Christmas Eve, we will be sharing popcorn and Christmas toys with children, reminding them that hope is alive and that they are seen, loved, and valued.
While many families celebrate Christmas with abundance, we choose to stand with those who have little because even the smallest gift, when given with love, can change a child’s day and warm their heart. 
We invite everyone to support, share, and stand with us as we spread joy, kindness, and hope this Christmas.
God first- together, we restore hope and touch lives. 🙏
